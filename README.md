Playground for ember

Learn ember by:

1. Reading the code and reviewing ember_flowchart
2. Read ember.js official documentation for indepth understanding of specific topics.

Note:
tiny app is developed by going through tutorial at:
   http://trek.github.com/

I found the above website is a better starting point for understanding ember.js than
official documentations.

Once I understand the application flow and have the first app down, I then move on to reading the official doc.
