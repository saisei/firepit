Playpen for learning ember.js

Learn ember by:

1. Reviewing ember_flowchart
2. Examine basic app's src code and its note file
3. Read ember.js official documentation for indepth understanding of specific topics.
4. Success!

Note:
basic app is developed by going through tutorial at:
   http://trek.github.com/
However I did modify a few things to ensure the code is working. 

I found the above website is a better starting point for understanding ember.js than the official documentations.

Once I understand the application flow and have the first app down, I then move on to reading the official doc.
